ExpressTrainer
==============

Express Trainer, rebranded to Pocket Trainer in the app, represents my work-in-progress to learn postgresql/Sequelize/Node.js/Express/Javascript stack.  All these technologies were brand new to me as of the start of this project.

It is currently a basic web app, with the following features:

A "Coach" role.  A Coach can login, view/update/create teams, view/update/create athletes, view/update/create workous, assign workouts, and review status of past workouts.  

An "Athlete" role.  An Athlete can login, view past/current/future workouts, and log progress of today's workout on-the-fly.
